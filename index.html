            <p class="description">The breed was once known as the Alsatian in Britain and Ireland. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic "saddle" to an over-all "blanket". As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting.</p>
